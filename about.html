      Hello! I’m Gabriel (he/him) and I am currently an undergraduate student
      from Portland State University. I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in
      Computer Science and will be graduating this summer.

      I have around a year of cumulative working experience. My most recent job
      was at Intel as an Undergrad Intern Technical, enjoying the complex day to
      day activities in the debug lab. Here is where I learned what they don’t
      teach in school: how to interact with a team on a daily basis, maintain
      working relationships, and work well even with difficult to work with
      individuals.
    </p>

      During my time here at Portland State, I took on the challenge of taking
      an Artificial Intelligence course. I had the chance to demonstrate and
      practice my programming skills through one of my favorite projects,
      writing a Genetic Algorithms solution for the Eight queens puzzle.
    </p>

      Outside of work and school I enjoy going for long drives with friends and
      finding fun ways to learn Japanese.
